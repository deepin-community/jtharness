# OpenJDK JT Harness

The JT harness is a general purpose, fully-featured, flexible, and configurable test harness very well suited for most types of unit testing. Originally developed as a test harness to run TCK test suites, it has since evolved into a general purpose test platform.

The JT harness:

 - Is designed to configure, sequence, and run test suites that consist of many (100,000 or more) discrete, independent tests. It is especially good at testing APIs and compilers.
 - Can be used to run tests on all of the Java platforms, from the Java Card platform, to the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition ("Java EE").
 - Enables you to create test suites that are self-contained products that customers can easily configure and run.

JT harness technology is being opened in order to develop a community that will improve it, further its development, and use it to develop test suites. We encourage you to browse, download, contribute, and get involved.
