    <p>Test Finders are used to locate and read test descriptions,
      which give details about the tests in a test suite. 
      Test descriptions are collections of name-value pairs, and
      may be represented in any form that can be read by a test finder.
      Two standard representations are as HTML tables, and as
      javadoc-style comments within Java source code.
