  <body>

    This package provides facilities for reading, executing
    and monitoring tests.

    <p>Tests are represented by {@link com.sun.javatest.TestDescription test descriptions},
      which are contained in a {@link com.sun.javatest.TestSuite test suite}. They are
      read by a {@link com.sun.javatest.TestFinder test finder}, and executed by a
      {@link com.sun.javatest.Script test script}, to produce a
      {@link com.sun.javatest.TestResult test result}. Internally, the test results
      are stored in a {@link com.sun.javatest.TestResultTable test result table};
      externally, the results are stored in a 
      {@link com.sun.javatest.WorkDirectory work directory}.
      Some configuration {@link com.sun.javatest.Parameters parameters} are required
      in order to read and run tests: these parameters may be collected by
      a {@link com.sun.javatest.InterviewParameters configuration interview}.
      Some limited support is also provided for an earlier parameter mechanism
      based on {@link com.sun.javatest.FileParameters parameter files}.

    <p>The finder used to locate the tests, the interview used to configure them
      and the script used to execute them are all determined by the test suite of
      which they are part.

    @since 3.0
