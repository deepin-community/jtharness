<title>Basic JavaTest tests</title>

<H1>Modified Basic JavaTest tests</H1>

This test-suite contains a collection of tests which are designed to exercise the
basic operation of JavaTest.  In order to provide a simple test of
the ability of the harness to tree-walk a set of pages, the tests are divided
into two groups, <a href="comp/index.html">compilation tests</a> and
<a href="exec/index.html">execution tests</a>.

<p>The tests in this test-suite are designed to exhibit a full range
of outcomes: tests that fail to compile, compile but don't execute,
compile and execute, and so on.  However, the names and descriptions
of the individual tests indicate the expected behavior of each test,
so that other tests in other test-suites may execute these tests and
mechanically determine if they behaved as expected, and if the harness
correctly reported their behavior.

<p>
This is a copy of the "basic" testsuite which has been modified to have a
more complex testsuite structure.  In particular, instead of a single HTML file
in each dir which describes all tests in that directory, they are now described
by at least two HTML files.  This will allow us to test initial URLs which are
intended select all tests which originate in a single file.
